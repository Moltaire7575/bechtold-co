The Beauty In Sorrow

I woke before sunrise and it was quite cold. I got to watch the "fantazmic" display of colors changing as a bright orange sun broke the horizon. I couldn't help but be enamored with the mist laying dense over the plains. Watching the sun rays reflect over this was peaceful. I could slowly see the fog dissipate as the sun no rose. It reminded me of all the sadness. The water will transform, change shape, and disappear as time and cycles progress. My sorrow and fears are like the mist—

Dense, cold, obstructive… and beautiful. Just like the water changes, so does the heart. Our memories fade, the emotions evaporate, and we are left with the fleeting beauty of change. Allowing space to be present in the moment is the only way to understand change. Not grasping the way things are allows for pure enjoyment of what is. Cycles come and go, some sooner than others. If you keep your eyes fixed, mind still, and heart open, you can see the beauty in it all.
