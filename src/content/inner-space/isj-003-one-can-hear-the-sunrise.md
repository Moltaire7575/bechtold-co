One Can Hear the Sunrise  
by Steve Bechtold

When awareness opens,
we don’t step into the world,
we begin to sense
that we were never separate from it.

In that space,
the act of hearing, seeing, or breathing
is no longer something we do,
but something happening through us.

When I wrote that
“with open awareness one can hear the sunrise,”
it wasn’t about sound at all,
but about the moment
perception and presence blend.

The way breath and breather
become indistinguishable,
awareness and world dissolve
into one continuous motion,
a seamless unfolding
of being itself.

The more still I became,
the more the boundary thinned.
Listening turned inward and outward at once,
as if the ear were a doorway
through which the world entered
and awareness returned.

Every tone,
every flicker of light,
felt like an echo
of something both within and beyond,
the same current
pulsing through it all.

And perhaps that’s what it means
to hear the sunrise:
to feel awareness opening into the ear itself.
Perception flowing softly through presence, 
the two becoming one,
until nothing remains but
the vibration of being, quiet and infinite.

Hum Hee Hum Brahm Hum
We are the universe,
and the universe is within us.
