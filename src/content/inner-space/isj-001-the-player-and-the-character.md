I went into a psychedelic journey carrying the kind of internal weight you don’t post about.

Not a single, clean problem. More like a knot: old pressure, recent stress, unfinished emotions—all of it mashed together into that familiar feeling of *something in me isn’t settled.*

I wasn’t looking for a vision. I was looking for **space**.

At first it stayed personal. I kept circling the same themes, the same memories, the same self‑talk. Then a voice—not exactly audible, more like a message with authority—started repeating a single sentence.

*You’ve been through this before.*

Again.

*You’ve been through this before.*

Not gentle. Not mystical. Almost irritating in how matter‑of‑fact it was. Like a coach who refuses to indulge your panic.

And with each repetition, my mind started pulling receipts.

Not in a dramatic montage way. In a blunt, documentary way: **here’s the time you thought you were done. Here’s the time you adapted. Here’s the time you kept walking anyway.**

The point wasn’t “look how tough you are.” The point was simpler—and strangely relieving:

This moment isn’t new. This feeling isn’t proof. It’s a pattern you’ve already outlived.

Then the whole thing shifted.

The “me” I normally inhabit—this name, this face, this storyline—started to feel optional.

My sense of identity slid into other forms, almost like trying on masks:

- an animal moving by instinct
- something flying
- something smaller: bacteria, amoeba, plant life
- smaller still: cells doing their quiet work
- then chemistry—reactions, molecules, forces
- then space itself as a kind of presence
- then something like a universe

None of it lasted long—seconds at most—but each one felt *real* while it was happening.

And when I came back, the takeaway wasn’t “I am the universe.” It was more practical than that:

> Awareness can wear a lot of costumes.

Which means my everyday identity—my personality, my story, my roles—is not the whole of what I am.

It’s a character.

And there’s something in me that can notice the character.

## The character I wear
Most of the time, I live like I’m the character:

- the name
- the preferences
- the self‑image
- the social role
- the opinions that feel like “me”
- the fears that feel permanent
- the mental autobiography that insists it’s the whole truth

The character is real in the same way a job title is real. Useful. Operable. Socially legible.

But it isn’t the whole sky.

## The player that can notice the character
Every so often—through meditation, a hike, a dream, or an altered state—the character loosens and something wider becomes obvious.

The cleanest way I know to describe it is this:

- **The character** is the identity (story, roles, personality).
- **The player** is the awareness that can *notice* the character.

That “noticing” is subtle. It doesn’t arrive with fireworks. It’s more like stepping back half an inch inside your own experience and realizing you’ve been white‑knuckling the steering wheel.

## Dreams: evidence that “I” is more flexible than I admit
Dreams make this hard to ignore.

In a dream, “I” can become a different person. Sometimes I’m not even human. Sometimes I’m pure emotion, pure movement, pure atmosphere. Sometimes I’m an observer without a face.

The identity changes… and yet the *knowing* is still there.

When I wake up, it’s easy to file it under “just a dream,” like it doesn’t count. But it counts at least as a simple piece of evidence:

> The sense of “I” is more flexible than my daytime identity wants to believe.

So when I over‑identify with the body and the egoic story, I’m doing something subtle but expensive: I’m compressing a flexible field of awareness into a rigid character sheet.

## The hidden cost of over‑identification
When I’m locked into identity, everything gets heavier:

- Every criticism feels personal.
- Every failure threatens the story.
- Every social moment becomes performance.
- Every uncomfortable emotion feels like a verdict.

Even a small comment can feel like a referendum on who I am.

But when identity loosens—even a little—the same life becomes lighter:

- Thoughts become weather instead of commands.
- Emotions become signals instead of definitions.
- The body becomes a home instead of a prison.
- Experience becomes something I can be with, not something I must defend myself against.

The paradox is that I don’t need to “destroy the ego” to get this relief.

I just need to stop treating it like it’s the only thing in the room.

## Identity‑Loosening Practice (5 minutes)
Try this once today. It’s small on purpose.

1. **Name the character**
   
   Silently: *“Here is the character: me.”* Notice the self‑image you’re carrying right now.

2. **Find the player**
   
   Ask: *“What is aware of this character right now?”* Don’t answer—just notice. Even if you only notice blankness, that counts.

3. **Shift the language**
   
   - “I’m aware of anxiety” instead of “I’m anxious.”
   - “I’m aware of thoughts about failing” instead of “I’m failing.”

4. **Tool vs. truth**
   
   *Identity is a tool. Awareness is the space it appears in.*

5. **One tiny test (1 hour)**
   
   For the next hour, treat thoughts like subtitles: you can read them without obeying them.

## Closing
I don’t think the goal is to reject the body or pretend the character doesn’t matter.

The character matters. It’s how we love, build, relate, and create.

But when I mistake the character for the player, life gets claustrophobic.

And when I remember the player—the simple fact of awareness—my day gets more breathable.
