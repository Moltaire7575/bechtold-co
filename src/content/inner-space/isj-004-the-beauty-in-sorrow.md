I woke before sunrise and it was cold enough that the air felt sharp.

Out on the plains, a bright orange sun started to break the horizon. The colors didn’t *arrive* so much as they unfolded—slowly, quietly—until the whole landscape looked like it was being painted in real time.

And then there was the mist.

Dense fog laid low over everything, thick enough to hide distance and make the world feel smaller than it was. When the first rays hit it, it turned *fantazmic*—glowing and alive, like the light was moving through something that had a mood.

It was peaceful to watch.

And it made me think about sadness.

Because the mist was doing what sorrow does. It was cold. Obstructive. Convincing. It made the field feel like the whole world.

But it was also undeniably beautiful.

And it wasn’t permanent.

As the sun rose, the fog began to thin. Not all at once. Not dramatically. Just… inevitably. Water changing form. Turning invisible. Returning to air.

That’s what sorrow does too.

It moves through us like weather. It has its season. It changes shape. It evaporates. And if we let it, it leaves behind something strangely tender: the feeling of being alive enough to have cared.

I don’t think the point is to romanticize pain or pretend suffering is “good.”

But I do think there’s a kind of beauty that only appears when we stop fighting reality long enough to actually *see it*.

The heart changes the way water changes.

Memories fade. Emotions soften. The grip loosens.

And life keeps moving.

## Practice: Sit With the Mist (7 minutes)
This is a practice for the moment you feel “foggy” emotionally—sad, afraid, heavy, uncertain.

1. **Name it without a story (30 seconds)**
   
   Say: *“This is sorrow.”* Or: *“This is fear.”* Don’t add why.

2. **Locate it in the body (1 minute)**
   
   Where is it most obvious—throat, chest, belly, face? What’s the texture (tight, dull, buzzing, hot, cold)?

3. **Give it room (3 minutes)**
   
   Breathe as if you’re making space around it. Not to push it away—just to stop squeezing it.

4. **Watch the change (2 minutes)**
   
   Without forcing anything, notice if it shifts even 1%: intensity, shape, location, temperature.

5. **One closing sentence (30 seconds)**
   
   Write or say: *“If I stop grasping for things to be different, I can see ______.”*

## Closing
The mist looks like it’s blocking everything—until the sun rises.

Sorrow can feel the same way.

Dense, cold, obstructive… and beautiful.

And if you keep your eyes fixed, mind still, and heart open, you can watch it change.
