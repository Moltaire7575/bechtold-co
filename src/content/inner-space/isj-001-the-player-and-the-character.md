I went into a **psychedelic** journey carrying the kind of internal weight you don’t post about.

Not a single, clean problem. More like a knot: old pressure, recent stress, unfinished emotions—all of it mashed together into that familiar feeling of *something in me isn’t settled.*

I wasn’t looking for a vision. I was looking for **space**.

At first it stayed personal. I kept circling the same themes, the same memories, the same self‑talk. Then a voice—not exactly audible, more like a message with authority—started repeating one sentence:

*You’ve been through this before.*

Again.

*You’ve been through this before.*

Not gentle. Not mystical. Almost irritating in how matter‑of‑fact it was. Like a coach who refuses to indulge your panic.

And with each repetition, my mind started pulling receipts.

Not in a dramatic montage way. In a blunt, documentary way: **here’s the time you thought you were done. Here’s the time you adapted. Here’s the time you kept walking anyway.**

The point wasn’t “look how tough you are.” The point was simpler—and strangely relieving:

This moment isn’t new. This feeling isn’t proof. It’s a pattern you’ve already outlived.

Then the whole thing shifted.

The “me” I normally inhabit—this name, this face, this storyline—started to feel optional.

My sense of identity slid into other forms, almost like trying on masks:

- an animal moving by instinct
- something flying
- something smaller: bacteria, amoeba, plant life
- smaller still: cells doing their quiet work
- then chemistry—reactions, molecules, forces
- then space itself as a kind of presence
- then something like a universe

None of it lasted long—seconds at most—but each one felt *real* while it was happening.

And when I came back, the takeaway wasn’t “I am the universe.” It was more practical than that:

> Awareness can wear a lot of costumes.

## The player and the character (in plain language)
Most of the time, I live like I’m the identity:

- the name
- the preferences
- the self‑image
- the social role
- the opinions that feel like “me”
- the fears that feel permanent
- the mental autobiography that insists it’s the whole truth

That identity isn’t fake. It’s useful.

But that night reminded me there’s something else here too: the part of me that can **notice** the identity.

Not a belief. Not a spiritual badge. Just a simple fact you can test:

- I can notice my thoughts.
- I can notice my emotions.
- I can notice my self‑image.

So I’m not identical to any of them.

If we want a metaphor, that’s what I mean by “the player and the character”:

- the *character* is the identity doing its thing
- the *player* is the awareness that can hold it without drowning in it

When that clicks—even briefly—life gets roomier. The same stressors exist, but they stop feeling like a total verdict on who I am.

## Dreams: evidence that “I” is more flexible than I admit
Dreams make this hard to ignore.

In a dream, “I” can become a different person. Sometimes I’m not even human. Sometimes I’m pure emotion, pure movement, pure atmosphere. Sometimes I’m an observer without a face.

The identity changes… and yet the *knowing* is still there.

When I wake up, it’s easy to file it under “just a dream,” like it doesn’t count. But it counts at least as a simple piece of evidence:

> The sense of “I” is more flexible than my daytime identity wants to believe.

So when I over‑identify with the body and the egoic story, I’m doing something subtle but expensive: I’m compressing a flexible field of awareness into a rigid character sheet.

## The hidden cost of over‑identification
When I’m locked into identity, everything gets heavier:

- Every criticism feels personal.
- Every failure threatens the story.
- Every social moment becomes performance.
- Every uncomfortable emotion feels like a verdict.

Even a small comment can feel like a referendum on who I am.

But when identity loosens—even a little—the same life becomes lighter:

- Thoughts become weather instead of commands.
- Emotions become signals instead of definitions.
- The body becomes a home instead of a prison.
- Experience becomes something I can be with, not something I must defend myself against.

The paradox is that I don’t need to “destroy the ego” to get this relief.

I just need to stop treating it like it’s the only thing in the room.

## Identity‑Loosening Practice (5 minutes)
Try this once today. It’s small on purpose.

1. **Name the character**

   Silently: *“Here is the character: me.”* Notice the self‑image you’re carrying right now.

2. **Find the player**

   Ask: *“What is aware of this character right now?”* Don’t answer—just notice. Even if you only notice blankness, that counts.

3. **Shift the language**

   - “I’m aware of anxiety” instead of “I’m anxious.”
   - “I’m aware of thoughts about failing” instead of “I’m failing.”

4. **Tool vs. truth**

   *Identity is a tool. Awareness is the space it appears in.*

5. **One tiny test (1 hour)**

   For the next hour, treat thoughts like subtitles: you can read them without obeying them.

## Closing
I don’t think the goal is to reject the body or pretend the character doesn’t matter.

The character matters. It’s how we love, build, relate, and create.

But when I mistake the character for the player, life gets claustrophobic.

And when I remember the player—the simple fact of awareness—my day gets more breathable.
